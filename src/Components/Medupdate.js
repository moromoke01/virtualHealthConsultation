              The most reported symptoms of six cardiovascular diseases (CVDs):
              heart attack, heart failure, valve disease, stroke, heart rhythm
              disorders, and peripheral artery and vein disease (PAD and PVD).
              <br />
              <br/>
              <b>Depression</b> may influence a personâ€™s ability to detect
              changes in symptoms. Effective methods of monitoring and measuring
              symptoms over time are critical to managing cardiovascular disease
              well and preventing or delaying its progression.
              <br />
              <br />
              Chest pain is the most common and recognisable symptom of a heart
              attack. Less familiar symptoms, however, include shortness of
              breath, fatigue, sweating, nausea and lightheadedness.
